/*
 * In an application, the business logic resides within the service layer so we use the @Service Annotation to indicate 
 * that a class belongs to that layer.
One most important thing about the @Service Annotation is it can be applied only to classes.
It is used to mark the class as a service provider.
So overall @Service annotation is used with classes that provide some business functionalities.
Spring context will auto detect these classes when annotation-based configuration and class path scanning is used.

@Transactional annotation, which provides broad support for transaction management 
i.e insert, update, select & delete ,and allows developers to concentrate on business logic rather than
 worrying about data integrity in the event of system failures.
